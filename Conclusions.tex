The obtained emittance evolution of uncombined beam approximately agree with the current simulations. 
Injector produced between 40 and 50~mm~mrad. It was well preserved until the end of the linac.
%Even with the Stretching chicane the emittance at the injection of the Delay Loop and 
%the Combiner Ring was at the order of 



For the vertical plane the goal of 150~mm~mrad for the combined beam was achieved and 
for factor 4 in horizontal as well. For factor 8, 240~mm~mrad was achieved behind the Combiner Ring.

The evolution of the emittance along the machine was worse than expected in the machine design.
The reasons were understood thanks to more detailed calculations done only during machine operation.
First, the time variable injection bump of the Combiner Ring was not fully achromatic 
creating dispertion wave for the first injected sub-pulse.
Second, the isochronous optics of the Delay Loop and TL2 line was heavily constrained by 
the pre-existing building layout.
For the CTF3 Design Report adequate solutions were found. However, due to cost reasons,
and also due to evolving design of the machine, they were modified.
In particular, the assumed Dealy Loop lattice composed of 34 compact quadrupoles, 
which was replaced by 20 quadrupoles. 
The resulting optics yielded large non-linear dispersion leading to emittance growth 
of the beam with 0.6\%~r.m.s. energy spread. 
Additionlly, the implemented quadrupoles that were recycled from decomissioned machines
turned out to have insufficient precision. 
Because they were much larger, the remainig space allowed to install only a sub-optimal number of BPMs and orbit correctors. 
In consequence, the orbit control was very difficult and implementation of the sextuplar corrections,
which was hoped to limit the emittance growth, turned out to be impossible.
Also, the optics corrections were difficult because all the magnets were powered in pairs.

Another item hampering the optimizations was the machine stability. 
In the time scales required for emittance optimizations of the fully combined beam 
its characteristic was fluctuating 
%increasing the error bars above the required minimum.
such that the applied corrections were not accurate.
During the initial years it was virtually impossible to perofrm any emittance optimizations 
and only after implementation multiple feedback systems in 2012-2013 the situation become acceptable.
Still, agian for the Delay Loop, the jittering septa power supply could not be fixed.
The Delay Loop optics turned out to be particularly sensitive to it and 
there was no flaxibility to reduce it. 
Finally, the total beam time when all 3 SHB 1.5~GHz sources were avialable was relatively short
and proportianlly the operational experience with this beam was much smaller than with the 3~GHz beam.
