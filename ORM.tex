\subsection{Orbit Response Matrix}

The initial optics checks were done using Orbit Response Matrix method, where each
orbit corrector magnet is powered to observe the downstream orbit response. 
This way transfer matrix coefficient $R_{12}$ between the corrector magnet and 
the downstram BPMs is directly measured and can be compared
with the model values.

For each orbit measurement at least 5 consecutive shots were acquired, usually 7 or 10.
In a simple case the amplitude of the corrector excitations was the same for all devices
and was chosen to be the largest not provoking any important beam losses.
In order to maximize accuracy, in more sophisticated variant of the method, the excitation was
gradually increased for each corrector until the beam was fully transported over
4-5 downstream BPMs. For each BPM the measured offsets were plotted in function of 
the corrsponding corrector excitation currents and 
fitted in the range where no beam loss at given BPM was observed.
The tool was implemented in a MatLab script that 
fully automatized the measurement. 
The main results are listed in Section~\ref{sec:03_ModelImprovs}
